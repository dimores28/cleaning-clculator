            How much will it cost to clean my home?
         </button>
         <div class="spollers__body">
            When determining your home cleaning cost we recognize that every home is as unique as the homeowner. We base your exact price on many factors including pets, clutter, floor types, as well as, the number of people who live there. 
            Call +18252887200 for a free phone estimate and schedule an appointment to meet with the local owner or manager for more details about our service and an exact price to clean your home.

            Will it cost the same each time you come to my house?
         </button>
         <div class="spollers__body">
            The Detail-Clean Rotation System starts with two initial cleans. The initial cleans get your house detail clean by cleaning areas other companies often neglect. Because these two cleans take additional time we typically charge an additional fee. After your initial cleans, the price will not vary between visits.

            Will you come on the same day and time for each clean?
         </button>
         <div class="spollers__body">
            While we can commit to a specific day, there are many factors throughout the day that may affect our actual arrival time. If you desire an estimated time of arrival on the day of your clean, please call us, and we’ll be glad to oblige.
