              CLEANING AFTER RENOVATION: WHY SHOULD YOU TURN TO PROFESSIONALS?
            </h1>
            <div class="post__content">
              <p>
                Any repair, even the shortest, leaves behind a lot of garbage in
                the apartment. After repair and construction work, there are
                traces of building materials (plaster, putty, cement-sand
                mixture), paint and varnish materials, glue, adhesive tape. It
                is also necessary to collect and take out large fractions of
                construction debris. Please note that it is strictly forbidden
                to take them out to household waste containers – construction
                waste must be taken to special landfills for disposal.
              </p>

              <p>
                The main enemy is dust. After the repair, a huge amount of dust
                circulates in the air. To remove it on your own, you need to
                repeat the process of cleaning absolutely all surfaces (walls,
                floors, ceiling, window sills, door jambs) many times – as soon
                as the dust has been cleaned from the area, it is covered with
                it again. Particles that were previously in the air settle.
                Repeat cleaning will need not two or three times.Cleaning in
                Calgary after renovation includes:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>removal of construction debris;</li>

                <li>cleaning surfaces from dust and dirt;</li>

                <li>furniture cleaning.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                After assessing the scale of pollution, you can understand how
                best to clean – on your own, or with the help of professionals
                from a cleaning company. You should also consider some features
                of this type of cleaning, which may also affect your decision.

                What you need to know about cleaning the apartment after
                renovation?
              </h2>

              <p>
                Such work should be treated as a large complex of works, because
                it includes: removal of construction debris; dust cleaning;
                ventilation cleaning; cleaning surfaces from residues of
                building materials.
              </p>

              <p>
                Note that cleaning in Calgary different surfaces may require
                special cleaners that will effectively remove dirt without
                damaging the surface. In addition, you will have to clean up in
                hard-to-reach places – sometimes dust clogs even into small
                cracks and ventilation holes, leading to further constant
                pollination of the apartment. This, in turn, can cause serious
                health problems in the future.
              </p>

              <p>
                To speed up the cleaning process and improve its quality,
                special equipment is used – construction professional vacuum
                cleaners, steam generators, rotary machines. You hardly have
                such equipment at home – it is very expensive, and in everyday
                life, they are not used for ordinary household cleaning. It will
                not work to replace a construction vacuum cleaner with an
                ordinary one – it will not cope with such an amount of dust and
                will simply fail. But the cleaning company has this equipment.
                Its use is included in the cost of cleaning and allows you to
                perform the work as quickly and efficiently as possible.

                Clean up the dirt yourself or delegate to professionals?
              </h2>

              <p>
                In the event that you have a clear cleaning algorithm after the
                repair, as well as all the necessary cleaning products, you can
                clean the apartment on your own. Do not forget that
                self-cleaning can take a whole day, or even more than one, so
                you do not need to plan anything for it. Instead of relaxing or
                thinking about receiving guests, you have to wash windows and
                floors, as well as clean upholstered furniture and remove dirty
                stains from interior doors.
              </p>

              <p>
                However, in most cases, this work should be entrusted to the
                specialists (cleaning service) of the cleaning company. You need
                to do this for a number of reasons:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  these people know how to quickly bring perfect cleanliness,
                  and what to use for this.
                </li>

                <li>
                  professional cleaning in many ways turns out to be more
                  efficient and profitable – and there are reasons for this: the
                  work of cleaning specialists on technological maps specially
                  designed for each room – detailed instructions that speed up
                  cleaning and indicate what is needed for each surface;
                </li>

                <li>
                  professional cleaning products are used – environmentally
                  friendly and safe for both furniture and apartment residents;
                  the time for which cleanliness can be achieved is reduced as a
                  result of the work of several people and the presence of a
                  technological map;
                </li>

                <li>
                  the customer of services can save his time and do his own
                  business during the cleaning.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                When cleaning is carried out by professionals, they will not
                miss a single centimeter of the contaminated area. You can check
                the quality of cleaning by swiping your finger along the top
                edge of the interior doors or the bottom shelf of the bookcase,
                almost hidden from view – perfect cleanliness and lack of dust
                are guaranteed!
              </p>
