            How to get rid of mold

            <p> Any repair, even the shortest, leaves behind a lot of garbage in the apartment. After repair and
              construction work, there are traces of building materials (plaster, putty, cement-sand mixture), paint and
              varnish materials, glue, adhesive tape. It is also necessary to collect and take out large fractions of
              construction debris. Please note that it is strictly forbidden to take them out to household waste
              containers – construction waste must be taken to special landfills for disposal.</p>



            <p> The main enemy is dust. After the repair, a huge amount of dust circulates in the air. To remove it on
              your own, you need to repeat the process of cleaning absolutely all surfaces (walls, floors, ceiling,
              window sills, door jambs) many times – as soon as the dust has been cleaned from the area, it is covered
              with it again. Particles that were previously in the air settle. Repeat cleaning will need not two or
              three times.Cleaning in Calgary after renovation includes:</p>



            <ul>
              <li>removal of construction debris;</li>



              <li>cleaning surfaces from dust and dirt;</li>



              <li>furniture cleaning.</li>
            </ul>



            <p> After assessing the scale of pollution, you can understand how best to clean – on your own, or with the
              help of professionals from a cleaning company. You should also consider some features of this type of
              cleaning, which may also affect your decision.</p>



            <h2 class="wp-block-heading">What you need to know about cleaning the apartment after renovation?</h2>



            <p> Such work should be treated as a large complex of works, because it includes: removal of construction
              debris; dust cleaning; ventilation cleaning; cleaning surfaces from residues of building materials.</p>



            <p> Note that cleaning in Calgary different surfaces may require special cleaners that will effectively
              remove dirt without damaging the surface. In addition, you will have to clean up in hard-to-reach places –
              sometimes dust clogs even into small cracks and ventilation holes, leading to further constant pollination
              of the apartment. This, in turn, can cause serious health problems in the future.</p>



            <p> To speed up the cleaning process and improve its quality, special equipment is used – construction
              professional vacuum cleaners, steam generators, rotary machines. You hardly have such equipment at home –
              it is very expensive, and in everyday life, they are not used for ordinary household cleaning. It will not
              work to replace a construction vacuum cleaner with an ordinary one – it will not cope with such an amount
              of dust and will simply fail. But the cleaning company has this equipment. Its use is included in the cost
              of cleaning and allows you to perform the work as quickly and efficiently as possible.</p>



            <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Clean up the dirt yourself or delegate to professionals?</h2>



            <p> In the event that you have a clear cleaning algorithm after the repair, as well as all the necessary
              cleaning products, you can clean the apartment on your own. Do not forget that self-cleaning can take a
              whole day, or even more than one, so you do not need to plan anything for it. Instead of relaxing or
              thinking about receiving guests, you have to wash windows and floors, as well as clean upholstered
              furniture and remove dirty stains from interior doors.</p>



            <p> However, in most cases, this work should be entrusted to the specialists (cleaning service) of the
              cleaning company. You need to do this for a number of reasons:</p>



            <ul>
              <li>these people know how to quickly bring perfect cleanliness, and what to use for this.</li>



              <li>professional cleaning in many ways turns out to be more efficient and profitable – and there are
                reasons for this: the work of cleaning specialists on technological maps specially designed for each
                room – detailed instructions that speed up cleaning and indicate what is needed for each surface;</li>



              <li>professional cleaning products are used – environmentally friendly and safe for both furniture and
                apartment residents; the time for which cleanliness can be achieved is reduced as a result of the work
                of several people and the presence of a technological map;</li>



              <li>the customer of services can save his time and do his own business during the cleaning.</li>
            </ul>



            <p> When cleaning is carried out by professionals, they will not miss a single centimeter of the
              contaminated area. You can check the quality of cleaning by swiping your finger along the top edge of the
              interior doors or the bottom shelf of the bookcase, almost hidden from view – perfect cleanliness and lack
              of dust are guaranteed!</p>
